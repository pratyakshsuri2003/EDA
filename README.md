# Exploratory Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of Jupyter Notebook files that cover a range of data analysis and machine learning projects. Each notebook is a separate project where I explore and analyze different datasets, perform data visualization, and in some cases, apply machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.

## Table of Contents
