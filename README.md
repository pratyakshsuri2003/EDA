# Exploratory Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of Jupyter Notebook files that cover a range of data analysis and machine learning projects. Each notebook is a separate project where I explore and analyze different datasets, perform data visualization, and in some cases, apply machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.

## Table of Contents

1. [Zomato Review Analysis](ZOMATO_REVIEWS.ipynb)
   - Analyzing restaurant reviews from Zomato to understand customer preferences and trends.

2. [Super Market Sales Analysis](Supermarket_Sales_Analysis.ipynb)
   - Exploring sales data from a supermarket to gain insights into product performance and customer behavior.

3. [Black Friday Sales Analysis](BLACK_FRIDAY.ipynb)
   - Analyzing Black Friday sales data to uncover shopping trends and patterns.

4. [House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression](House_Price_Prediction.ipynb)
   - Building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features.

5. [Customer Shopping Trends Analysis](CUSTOMER_SHOPPING_TRENDS.ipynb)
   - Investigating customer shopping behaviors and preferences to improve marketing strategies.

6. [Predictive Analysis on Titanic Dataset](Predictive_Analysis_on_Titanic_Data-Set.ipynb)
   - Applying machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

7. [Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition](Neural_Network_for_Handwritten_Digit_Claasification.ipynb)
   - Building and training neural networks to recognize handwritten digits.

## Getting Started

To explore any of these projects, simply click on the corresponding link above, which will take you to the Jupyter Notebook file. You can view the code, visualizations, and analysis within each notebook.

## Prerequisites

To run these notebooks and reproduce the results, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python (recommended version 3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn (for machine learning projects)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
